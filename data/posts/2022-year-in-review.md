As 2022 comes to a close, I want to reflect on my personal and professional journey over the past 12 months. It’s been a
year of highs and lows, victories and setbacks, lessons learned, and growth.

One of the biggest challenges I faced this year was the loss of several relationships that were important to me.

It was a challenging and painful experience, making me question many things about myself and my choices. But as
difficult as it was, I also learned a lot about myself and what I value in my relationships.

Another challenge I faced was that I didn’t complete most of my goals for the year. Not achieving my dreams was a source
of frustration and disappointment, making me feel like I was falling short somehow.

But as I looked back on the year, I realized that while I may not have achieved all that I set out to do, I made
progress and learned a lot along the way.

In my personal life, I regret not spending more time with my siblings and family. I didn’t prioritize my relationships
with them as much as I should have. I plan to do much better in the coming year and make more time for the people who
matter most to me.

I also want to express my gratitude to the Kwagei family. They have been there for me through all the highs and lows; I
am grateful for them.

I want to shout out Nathan, who has always been my guy and a handful in many ways (although he is a fool, ha). And to
Blessing, who has been a gem and an annoyance (in the best way) throughout this journey.

She doesn’t like to be called minor, but that’s what happens when you’re the oldest. She has helped to make this journey
worth the ride, both professionally and personally.

To Albin, Ben, and James, I love you guys and will always do my best to make sure that we all learn and grow
professionally with God’s guidance.

And to my amazing boss, Kpetermeni, no words can give a perfect picture of how your involvement has impacted my life and
that of my family. I am even trying to lose weights, damn! It feels like God knows how to answer prayers.

To my family, supporters, and well-wishers, I am grateful to have you as part of my experience. In five years, I have
seen wonders like never before; God has been faithful in protecting and guiding me through it all.

Looking back on 2022, it is a year of growth and learning. It was an intricate and sometimes complicated journey, but
This year filled it with hope and possibility. And as I look toward the future, I am excited and optimistic about what
the next year will bring.
