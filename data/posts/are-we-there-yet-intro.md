It has been quite a while since I have had the time to put my thoughts into words and explore how my mind thinks the world works.

Society has taught me that to be a man, I must become camouflage myself, hiding my true feelings and emotions. But is that really what it means to be a man? Is it wrong to cry, to show vulnerability, or to seek love and happiness?

These questions drive the “Are we there yet?” series, a personal and open-ended exploration of the human condition. Through a series of essays and articles, I will share my thoughts and experiences as I search for the meaning of my life and try to understand the world around me.

I am not an expert writer or **motivational speaker**, but we can all learn and grow by sharing my thoughts and inviting others to join the conversation.


So come along on this journey with me as we seek to answer the age-old question: Are we there yet?
